This script is designed to collect and analyze archived website data from the Wayback Machine.

It works by reading a list of domains and proxy servers, then retrieving snapshots of each domain at several points in time (today, 1 year ago, 2.5 years ago, and 4 years ago). Each request is routed through a random proxy to balance the load. For every valid snapshot, the script extracts the page title, meta description, meta keywords, and generates a short summary of the homepage text using an LSA-based summarizer. It also checks whether the snapshot is a redirection.

All results are saved in a timestamped CSV file, and the process is run in parallel with multiple threads to improve efficiency.
